## Running Locally
### pre-requisite
We suggest setting up the environment using `conda`, and it's important to make sure that `npm` is installed prior to executing the scripts that follow.

#### Developing
Afterwards, you can install dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), and start a development server:

```bash
npm update
npm install
npm run dev -- --open
```
